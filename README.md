# Frontend Assessment Repository

## Assessment Steps

The steps you will follow:

1. Clone this repository to your local computer
2. After cloning, create and switch to a new branch called `front-end-assessment`
3. The questions are in the `/assessment` folder, the study materials are in the `/study` folder. In each folder, there is a `README.md` file, which explains how to use that folder.
4. Whenever you solve a question, you will do a commit for that solution. So we expect a commit for each question solved.
5. After you are done, push your changes to your own github account/repository( which needs to be a public one, so we can see it).
6. Once you pushed all your work, and ready to submit, send the link to your repository to us, we will start examining.


## Additional Information About Repository And Assessment

- For how we evaluate the assessment, we look for 3 things in this order of importance:
  1. Clean, simple and easy to understand code
  2. How many of them you finished
  3. How quickly you finished



- There is an `index.html` file in each folder, which you can open with either:
  - Double clicking and opening with a browser
  - Use a static live server extension of your favourite IDE (for example, Visual Studio Code, Live Server extension)

- `/assessment` folder will have the questions for you (depending on your application, there are different question folders)
  - Do as many questions as possible, even half finished ones you can submit. It helps us to get a good assessment of your expertise.
  - The questions will be getting harder and harder, so a small advice: try to work on them in order `question1.js` => `question2.js` etc.
  - The study folder is our way of helping you, try to use these materials
  - Even if you solved the questions without help from study materials, we suggest you to take a look at the materials. In the face to face interview, we will be asking some of javascript concepts that are in the study materials.

- `/study` folder is there to help you, don't ignore these materials.

  - You can use them when solving the assessment questions.
  - You can also use them to refresh your JavaScript knowledge.
  - If you are new to the concepts in these materials, there are `Hint`s and `Extra`s that will guide you to research the topics.

- `/study/utils` is just a collection of helper functions, not that important for assessment.
