- The `index.html` files in each folder are the starting points. You need to change/add script tags for javascript files.

- There are various hints and questions in these files to guide your study. Try to answer the questions and follow the hints to learn more about JavaScript.

- I would advise you to not only see the outputs, but also change and modify these files as you wish and experiment with them.
